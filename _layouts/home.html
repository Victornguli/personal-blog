            I am currently working on <span>TechJobsAggregator</span>, a simple fullstack application for aggregating
            tech jobs posted on various local(Kenyan) job boards. This project was inspired by a previous project which
            was limited to a <a href="">CLI tool</a> that scraping those job boards.about

        <p>
            Previously, I have created several tiny projects, mostly scripts and automation tools.
            I have abandoned numerous of these projects but the several that have survived and lived to
            see decent progress are showcased on my <a href="">projects page</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a background in software engineering with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Chuka
            University,
            where I graduated on 2019. I have also held a Software Developer position at Financeplan ltd, where I enjoy
            contributing and collaborating in developement and maintanence of financial related software systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I consider myself a fullstack developer but my skillset is skewed towards backend development, mainly
            developing systems in Python, NodeJs and C#. I often dabble in UI development too and enjoy creating
            Angular.js frontends and a huge fan of JAMSTACK as I have developed this site with Jekyll.
            I also enjoy creating automation scripts and bots to ease repetitive and manual tasks.
